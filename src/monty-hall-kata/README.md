## Monty Hall Kata

Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. `1`, and the host, Monty Hall, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. `3`, and reveals a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. `2`?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The Monty Hall simulation is a way to predict what choice of door is more likely for the contestant to drive home a brand new car.

This Kata focuses on a miniature version of this simulation -- some possibilities when choosing a door. Creating and simulating the game with `n` turns is left up for homework.
